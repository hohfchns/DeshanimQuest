# **DeshanimQuest - An RPG by hohfchns/Hanzofactory, DSDusty, and LordanHax/sounD**

The roadmap for the game can be found here: https://trello.com/b/llTLmu8z/deshanimquest-roadmap

## Information

This game is a passion project. It will most likely not be monitized in any way.

The game is developed in the Godot game engine and uses the Dialogic plugin for dialog.

The game is programmed mostly on Linux, so Linux support is guaranteed and tested.

**Disclaimers**

This game is going to be almost fully in Hebrew (debug purposes and early phases might be English), and English translations are unlikely.

This game contains a lot of references to our school and real life, so some confusion is unavoidable for people who don't know us.
